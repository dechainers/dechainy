# DeChainy

An open source framework to easily build and deploy eBPF/XDP network monitoring probes and clusters of probes, in order to perform Service Programs Chain efficiently. This framework is supposed to help and ease life to both new eBPD/XDP users, and to the ones who need to customize more their programs. DeChainy is not supposed to substitute already existent framework; on the other hand, its aim is to offer a wider choice of possibilities for also those users who are experimenting eBPF with other Python-friendly technologies, like TensorFlow (for Machine Learning).
