# Tools

This folder (and all its sub-folders) contains useful tools built within this framework. Each program has its own description, so you may want to check out the following folders:

* [statistics_gatherer](statistics_gatherer): Adaptmon probe to gather statistics (n° packets, n° bits, etc.) concerning incoming and outgoing traffic from a specific network interface (used in the examples).
* [ddos_analyzer](ddos_analyzer): Adaptmon probe to extract features from incoming and outgoing packets, in order to feed a Neural Network, which predicts possible cyberattacks, following the model presented in the [Lucid paper](https://github.com/doriguzzi/lucid-ddos).
